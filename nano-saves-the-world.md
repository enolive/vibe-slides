# Nano Will Save The World: A Totally Objective Essay (On Slides)

Welcome to the smallest, brightest hill to die on: nano > vim > emacs. Yes, I said it. Grab your popcorn and your Ctrl key. 🍿⌨️

# Thesis: Simplicity Beats Wizardry

- Nano: open, type, save, done. 🧼
- Vim: first you must defeat a miniboss named “Normal Mode.” 🧙‍♂️
- Emacs: an entire operating system that occasionally edits text. 🛸

Simplicity scales to humanity. Humanity scales to impact. Impact saves the world. 🌍

# Onboarding New Humans, Not Initiates

- New contributor joins your project.
- You say: “Just nano README.md.” They succeed in 10 seconds.
- Alternate timeline: a 3‑hour ritual on how to exit vim, or compiling Emacs with 19 modules.

Every barrier you remove accelerates open knowledge. The world gets better faster. ⚡️

# The Exit Problem (aka: :q?!?!)

- Nano: Ctrl+X. Confirm. Go live your life. ✅
- Vim: Are you in Normal? Visual? Command? Did you pray to the colon? 😵
- Emacs: C-x C-c (after binding 7 packages and sacrificing your pinky). 🫡

Time not spent escaping editors is time spent fixing climate models, medicine, and public infrastructure. 🌱🏥🏗️

# Pinky Preservation Act

- Nano: gentle on tendons. 💅
- Vim: Esc Esc Esc Esc… welcome to RSI speedrun.
- Emacs: C-M-S-hyper-meta-super—your pinky called OSHA. 🧯

Healthier hands = healthier devs = more sustainable progress. That saves the world too. 🫶

# The Modal Maze vs. The Straight Line

- Modal editing is powerful—like giving a chainsaw to someone who asked for scissors.
- Nano gives you scissors. And a band‑aid. And a smile. ✂️😊

Straight lines ship faster than labyrinths. Shipping fixes beats arguing on forums. 🚢

# Plugin Paradox

- Vim/Emacs: Step 1) install plugin manager. Step 2) install plugins for plugin manager. Step 3) write a novel in Lisp or Lua.
- Nano: ships with sane defaults. It just works. 📦

Fewer moving parts = fewer bugs = fewer outages = less energy wasted rebooting your editor. Green coding, literally. 🌳

# Learn Once, Use Everywhere

- Nano is on basically every Linux box, cloud shell, and rescue environment.
- When a prod server is on fire, the best editor is the one you already know.

Lower cognitive load in crises means faster recoveries. Uptime for the planet! 🔥🧯🌐
<!-- end_slide -->

# Accessibility Is Not Optional

- Nano’s UI shows commands on screen. No gatekeeping, no lore.
- Vim/Emacs depend on tribal knowledge and dense docs.

Accessible tools invite more people to build. More builders = more solutions to global problems. 🤝🌎
<!-- end_slide -->

# Productivity Without A Cult

- Editing text shouldn’t require an initiation ritual.
- Nano users collaborate instead of configure.

Collaboration compounds. Compounding progress is how we tackle wicked problems. 📈🧩
<!-- end_slide -->

# Counterarguments (Lovingly Roasted)

- “But macros!” Great—most people need to write a commit message.
- “But modes!” Great—most people need to edit a config file at 2 a.m.
- “But extensibility!” Great—most people need to save and go to sleep.

Right tool, right job. Most jobs are small. Nano wins by not getting in the way. 🥇

# How Nano Saves The World (Yes, Really)

1) Reduces onboarding friction → more contributors to science/civic tech. 🧪🏛️
2) Cuts yak‑shaving → more time on climate, health, education. 🐂✂️
3) Lowers support load → fewer interruptions, more deep work. 🧠
4) Universal availability → resilient ops during disasters. 🚨

Small tools at planetary scale move mountains. ⛰️

# Call To Action

- Alias nothing. Install nothing. Just use nano.
- Teach a newcomer today. Watch their face not melt. 😌
- Save your wrists. Save your minutes. Save the planet—one Ctrl+X at a time. ♻️

Nano: because the future needs fixes, not fiddling. ✨
