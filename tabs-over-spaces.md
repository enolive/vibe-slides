# Tabs Are Obviously Superior To Spaces: An Irrefutable Thesis

Welcome to the Great Indentation War. Spoiler: tabs win. Prepare your Tab key and your convictions. ⌨️🎯

# The Fundamental Truth

**One tab = one indent. Simple. Pure. Correct.** ✨

**Spaces?** You need 2, or 4, or wait is it 3? Oh no, that file uses 8... chaos reigns. 😱

Tabs are democracy: everyone sees their preferred width. Spaces are tyranny: the first author decides forever. 🗽

# Accessibility: Tabs Actually Save The World

- **Visual impairments?** Set tab width to 8 for better visibility. 👁️
- **Small screens?** Set tab width to 2 for more code per line. 📱
- **Personal preference?** Set it to literally anything. 🎨

Spaces force everyone into the same rigid box. Tabs respect human diversity. That's how we build inclusive communities that save the world. 🌍🤝

# The Math Is Embarrassing

**One indent with tabs:** 1 character. 1 keystroke. 1 byte (usually). 📉

**One indent with spaces (4-space gang):** 4 characters. 4 keystrokes. 4 bytes. 📈

**100 indents?** That's 300 extra bytes. Per file. Multiply by 10,000 files. That's 3MB of *literally nothing*. 

Think of the polar bears. Think of the bandwidth. Think of the children. 🐻‍❄️🌱

# The Backspace Catastrophe

**Deleting a tab indent:** One beautiful Backspace. Done. ✅

**Deleting a space indent:** Backspace. Backspace. Backspace. Backspace. Wait, was that 3 or 4? Now it's misaligned. Backspace again. Now it's too far. Space. Space. Cry. 😭

Time saved with tabs = time spent curing diseases and solving climate change. Actual fact.* 🧬🌡️

*Not an actual fact, but feels true.

# Editor Agnostic Supremacy

**Tabs:** Work in vim, emacs, nano, VS Code, notepad.exe, a literal 1970s terminal. 💪

**Spaces:** Require "smart indent" features that sometimes work, sometimes delete 3 spaces, sometimes delete 5, sometimes achieve sentience and judge you. 🤖👎

Resilience in tooling = resilience in teams = resilience in civilization. You're welcome. 🏛️

# The Grep Argument

Need to find all indented lines in a project?

**Tabs:** `grep "^\t"` — clean, simple, poetic. 🎭

**Spaces:** `grep "^    "` or `grep "^  "` or `grep "^        "` — which is it?? Regex nightmare. Regular expression? More like irregular depression. 😵‍💫

Searchability saves debugging time. Debugging time saves production. Production saves the economy. 📊💰

# Mixing Is A Space Problem

**"But people mix tabs and spaces!"** 

Yes, and whose fault is that? SPACE USERS sneaking spaces into tab codebases. 🕵️

**Pure tab codebases:** Beautiful harmony. One character, one meaning. 🎵

**Pure space codebases:** Functional but inefficient. 😐

**Mixed codebases:** A crime scene. Spaces are always the accomplice. 🚔🚨

# Common Objections (Gently Roasted)

**"But Python style guide says spaces!"**
→ PEP 8 was written by humans. Humans make mistakes. Tabs are eternal. 🐍

**"But my team uses spaces!"**
→ Your team also uses Git. Convince them to upgrade their indent philosophy too. 💡

**"Tabs break alignment!"**
→ Use tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment. Best of both worlds. Evolution. 🧬

**"Silicon Valley said spaces win!"**
→ TV shows aren't peer-reviewed science. Neither is this presentation, but tabs are still right. 📺❌

# How Tabs Save The World (Yes, Actually)

1. **Accessibility:** Customizable display width helps developers with visual needs. ♿️
2. **Efficiency:** Smaller files = less storage = less energy = greener planet. 🌱
3. **Consistency:** One character, one concept. Less cognitive load, more focus on real problems. 🧠
4. **Inclusivity:** Your indent, your width. Respect for individual needs builds better teams. 🤗

Tabs aren't just indentation—they're a philosophy of flexibility and respect. 🏆✨

# The Final Word

If spaces worked, they'd be one character. 🎯

Tab users unite! We have nothing to lose but our carpal tunnel. ⚡️👊
