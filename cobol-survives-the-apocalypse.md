# COBOL: The Cockroach of Programming Languages 🪳

Why your grandfather's code will outlive your serverless functions and save humanity after the bombs drop. 💣🏚️

# Thesis: Old Is Gold, Cloud Is Mold

- COBOL: Born 1959. Still running. Still processing paychecks. 💰
- Cloud: Born yesterday. Dead tomorrow. Requires 47 microservices. ☁️💀
- When civilization reboots, guess which one still works? 🔌

Ancient code doesn't break. Ancient code saves the world. 🌍

# The Apocalypse Checklist

- ✅ Runs on hardware from 1985 (still works in bunkers!)
- ✅ No internet required (goodbye AWS outages!)
- ✅ No npm dependencies (no supply chain attacks!)
- ✅ Survived Y2K (your React app won't survive Y2.038K)
- ✅ Documentation printed on actual paper 📄

COBOL prepared for doomsday before it was cool. 😎

# Cloud? More Like Clown! 🤡

- "Oh no, AWS us-east-1 is down!" → Your business dies.
- "Oh no, the nuclear winter knocked out the internet!" → COBOL doesn't notice.
- Zero cloud dependencies = infinite uptime in the wasteland. 🏜️

When the satellites fall, mainframes will still be humming in underground vaults. 🛡️

# The Framework Fatigue Cure

- 2015: Learn Angular! 📚
- 2017: Angular is dead, learn React! ⚛️
- 2019: React is passé, learn Vue! 🖼️
- 2021: No wait, try Svelte! Actually try Solid! 🤯
- 2025: Just use COBOL. It's the same as 1959. 😌

Consistency is the ultimate developer experience. Peace of mind saves the world. 🧘

# Banking On The Right Horse 🏦

- Banks trust COBOL with trillions of dollars.
- Banks tried to rewrite in Java. Cost: billions. Result: went back to COBOL.
- 95% of ATM transactions? COBOL. 💳

If it's good enough for money, it's good enough for the apocalypse. Reliable systems keep society functioning. 🏛️

# No JavaScript Means No JavaScript Vulnerabilities

- COBOL security model: "Good luck finding someone under 60 who can read this."
- Modern web security: new CVE every 4 minutes. 🚨
- Post-apocalypse cybersecurity is easy when there's no cyber!

Unhackable by virtue of being incomprehensible to hackers. Genius! 🧠🔒

# Runs On A Potato (Literally) 🥔

- COBOL: Runs on 64KB of RAM.
- Your Slack app: Requires 2GB just to send "lol."
- When resources are scarce, efficiency isn't optional—it's survival.

Low resource usage = sustainable computing = saving the planet one batch job at a time. 🌱

# The Hiring Advantage Post-Collapse

- All the young devs fought over Kubernetes jobs. They're gone. 💀
- The COBOL programmers? Retired in their bunkers with the mainframes. Still billing $500/hour. 💵
- Knowledge scarcity = job security = civilization rebuilders.

When the dust settles, COBOL devs will be the new wizards. 🧙‍♂️✨

# The Ultimate Conclusion

COBOL doesn't need the cloud. The cloud needs COBOL. ⚡
